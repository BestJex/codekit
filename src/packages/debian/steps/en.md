mv /etc/apt/sources.list /etc/apt/sources.list.bak
```

deb {{link}}/ {{version}}-updates main contrib non-free
deb {{link}}/ {{version}}-backports main contrib non-free
deb {{link}}-security {{version}}/updates main contrib non-free

# deb-src {{link}}/ {{version}} main contrib non-free

# deb-src {{link}}/ {{version}}-backports main contrib non-free

```
